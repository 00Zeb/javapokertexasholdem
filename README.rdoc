== It's a Java SE implemention for Texas Hold'em Video Poker  (using TDD JUnit)

=== Check out the following example:

	GameTexasHoldem game = new GameTexasHoldem();
	game.newGame();
	game.deal();
	game.callFlop();
	game.betRiver();
	game.betTurn();
	GameEnum result = game.getWinner();

The game.getWinner() method returns GameEnum that contains the Game Result

	public enum GameEnum {
		PLAYER_WINNER, 
		DEALER_WINNER, 
		DRAW_GAME, 
		PLAYER_WINNER_BEST_RANKING, 
		DEALER_WINNER_BEST_RANKING, 
		PLAYER_WINNER_HIGH_CARD, 
		DEALER_WINNER_HIGH_CARD
	}
